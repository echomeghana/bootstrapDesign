This project is the product of years of iterative development and
community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development
philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the
way that you want.

*This doesn't mean that HTML5 Boilerplate cannot be used in older browsers,
just that we'll ensure compatibility with the ones mentioned above.*

If you need legacy browser support you
can use [HTML5 Boilerplate v4](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/tree/v4) (IE 6+, Firefox 3.6+, Safari 4+),
or [HTML5 Boilerplate v5](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/tree/v5.0.0) (IE8+). They are no longer actively developed.
